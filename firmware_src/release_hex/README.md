## Load-check firmware

`BDpressureE_loadcheck_20261007.hex` is the bd_pressure E firmware built from
the current source with the optional filament load-check extension. It
behaves like the stock firmware for Klipper's `bdpressure.py` and adds the
registers described in `../LOAD_CHECK.md`. Flashing from a Raspberry Pi and
usage: `../../klipper/load_check/README.md`.
